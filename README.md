# 🚀 AI/ML for Predicting GNSS Satellite Clock & Ephemeris Error Patterns

**Predicting time-varying error build-up between uploaded (broadcast) and ICD-based modeled GNSS satellite clock & ephemeris values using modern AI/ML.**

This project explores how generative AI and advanced time-series models can forecast the small-but-critical deviations between broadcast parameters and reference ICD models. Better forecasts of clock bias and ephemeris errors improve positioning, timing, and downstream high-precision applications.

## Why this matters
GNSS accuracy hinges on how well we can predict clock and orbital errors. Even subtle, time-varying deviations can degrade navigation and precision timing. This repository prototypes AI-driven solutions to detect and forecast these error patterns so operators and downstream systems can act earlier and more effectively.

## Highlights
- 📊 Analysis of broadcast vs ICD-modeled GNSS data  
- 🔍 Detection of time-varying error build-up patterns  
- 🧠 Prototype prediction architectures (generative + time-series models)  
- ⚙️ Baseline model implemented for future forecasting and benchmarking  
- 🎥 Short workflow & progress video included (see Demo section)

## Current status
~50% complete — pipeline, data analysis, and baseline modeling in place. Prototypes show encouraging results; next steps focus on model refinement, evaluation across satellites/constellations, and deployment-ready pipelines.
